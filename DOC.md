# Things to checkout
Because they look cool and I don't have time right now. These are also things that didn't cause any harm keeping around.

## From Holman
- bin/cloudapp
- all the commented out stuff in Brewfile

# Troubleshooting
- Do I need tap 'caskroom/cask' in Brewfile?

# Linux vs Mac
- Brewfile: cask_args appdir: '/Applications'

# Misc
- Run bin/dot periodically
